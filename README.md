# University of Porto â€“ Erasmus Year Projects

This repository contains academic projects developed during my Erasmus year at the University of Porto. All work was completed using RStudio, combining statistical modeling, simulation, and reproducible 
reporting with Quarto Documents.

**Risk Theory**  
Study of how insurance companies determine pricing based on statistical risk metrics and probability theory. Topics included premium calculation, risk distributions, and modeling financial uncertainty
using data-driven techniques.

**Simulation & Stochastic Processes**  
Application of simulation techniques and statistical concepts such as the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to model and analyze probabilistic systems. Focus on Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic behavior over time.

These projects reflect my academic growth and practical experience using RStudio and Quarto to build clear, professional, and reproducible analytical reports.

# IDpol: the policy ID
# ClaimNb: number of claims during the exposure period
# Exposure: period of exposure for a policy, in years
# VehPower: the power of the car
# VehAge: The vehicle age, in years
# DrivAge: The driver's age, in years
# BonusMalus: bonus/malus rating of policyholder (between 50 and 350) 
#             <100 means bonus
# VehBrand: brand of the car
# VehGas: car's fuel type
# Area: density-rating of the community that the car driver lives in, divided 
#       into categories: from "A"-rural area to "F"-urban
